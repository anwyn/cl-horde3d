* Transformation principles
  
  - dropped h3d prefix and used a package instead
  - lispified symbols
  - dropped type suffices, in a dynamic typed language they make less
    sense
  - dropped Element suffixes (debatteable)
  - adhered to the common-lisp tradition of not using abbreviations,
    so I renamed
    - 'res' to resource
    - 'mat' to material (or matrix)
    - 'vert' to vertex
    - elem to element
    - comp to component
    -
